DMOJ Bot is a discord bot developed mainly using discord.py, repl.it, DMOJ api and flask webserver to keep the bot running. It provides some basic functions such as user statistics and graphs, as well as functions that keep track of daily problem solves and functions that allows 2 users to race to solve a problem.
More functionality was planned but further development is unlikely for now.

## Usage
Unfortunately, DMOJ-Bot remains a private bot for now.
